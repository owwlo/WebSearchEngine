We chose two iterations with lamda = 0.90 for our search engine.

Since PageRank is a way to simulate user's visits to specific Web page, it would be the best if pagerank score shows the same semantic meaning as numviews'. One iteration is insufficient to represent user's visit due to our experiment (although the ranking differences between results are small) while lamda = 0.90 is a better way to balance the weights of random matrix and click possibility values. 0.10 will emphasis much more on random click possibility which we think is not a good idea.
